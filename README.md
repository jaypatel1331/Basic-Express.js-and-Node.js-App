# Basic-Express.js-and-Node.js-App
This is basic app created with Express.js and Node.js as the back-end. It process data and show the output by filtering that data using the javascript. HTMl and CSS make is more beautiful.
 You need to add Node.js and Express.js to this project to make is work successfully. You can navigate to the folders using node.js and I created the Express server for the back-end purpose for extracting data and processing it.
